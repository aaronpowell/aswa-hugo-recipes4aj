But I wanted to explore using Hugo with [Azure Static Web Sites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/) for two reasons:  * Take advantage of [built-in benefits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview#key-features) like GitHub CI/CD, free SSL certifications and easy serverless integrations with Azure Functions.  * Have a static web app that I could use as a sandbox to explore other web development tools and technologies including end-to-end testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) using a blogging framework I was familiar with.",
